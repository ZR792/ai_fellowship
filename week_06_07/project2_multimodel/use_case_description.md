# Multimodal AI System — Image and Document Understanding

## Overview
This project is a **Multimodal AI Application** that can understand both **textual** and **visual** information.  
It combines **image analysis**, **optical character recognition (OCR)**, and **text reasoning** to extract and interpret information from multiple types of data (images, charts, and PDFs).

The model demonstrates how AI can process and connect text + images together — just like humans do.

---

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Build an AI system capable of analyzing **visual content** (like photos, charts, or scanned documents).
- Perform **text extraction** using OCR.
- Handle **long textual documents** and generate summaries or insights.
- Show how multimodal AI can combine these capabilities to generate intelligent outputs.

---

## Motivation
In real-world applications, data is not just text — it often includes **images, charts, invoices, and scanned reports**.  
This project demonstrates how a **multimodal AI assistant** can understand all these formats together, enabling:
- Smarter document reading tools.
- Accessibility solutions for visually impaired users.
- Automated business report summarization.
- Visual Q&A assistants.

## System Workflow
1. **Input:**  
   The system takes input files from the `/images` folder and a long text PDF file.  
   - `photo.jpg` → for scene/image analysis  
   - `document.png` → for OCR extraction  
   - `chart.png` → for visual reasoning  
   - `long_text.pdf` → for text summarization  

2. **Processing:**  
   - Image data is sent to a **Vision model (Gemini or local fallback)** for description and reasoning.  
   - Text is extracted from documents using **Tesseract OCR**.  
   - PDF content is chunked, embedded (via FAISS), and summarized contextually.  

3. **Output:**  
   The results — including image captions, OCR text, and summaries — are saved in  
   `outputs/example_outputs.md`.

## Components Used
- **Gemini API (Vision Model):** For multimodal understanding.  
- **Tesseract OCR:** For text extraction from document images.  
- **PyPDF2 / pdfplumber:** For extracting text from PDF files.  
- **SentenceTransformers + FAISS:** For document embeddings and retrieval.  
- **Python:** For data processing and integration.

---

## Example Use Case
Imagine a company receiving **scanned invoices and reports**.  
Instead of manually reading each file:
- The multimodal AI extracts invoice details using OCR.  
- Summarizes long reports from PDFs.  
- Interprets charts to identify performance trends.  

This makes the analysis **automated, faster, and more intelligent**.

---

## Outcome
The project successfully integrates **multiple AI modalities** (text + vision).  
It can:
- Read and describe images.
- Extract text from printed or handwritten documents.
- Understand and summarize large text files.
- Provide combined insights across different input types.
