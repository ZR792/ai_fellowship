# Buildables AI Fellowship Projects

This repository contains all my submissions, assignments, and projects completed as part of the **Buildables AI Fellowship Program**.  
Each week's work is organized into its own folder for better structure and easy navigation.

## **Repository Structure**

- **WEEK_1_TASK/**  
  Contains the source code, documentation, and any related files for Week 1 tasks.
  
- **WEEK_2_TASK/** *(if applicable)*  
  Contains submissions for Week 2 tasks.

- **...**  
  Similar structure will be followed for subsequent weeks.

## **Contents of Each Folder**

Each week's folder generally includes:
1. **Source Code** – Python scripts or any other programming language files.
2. **Documentation** – Details about the task, approach, and usage.
3. **Sample Input/Output Files** (if provided).
4. **Requirements.txt** – Dependencies for the project (if any).
