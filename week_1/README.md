# Text Analysis Tool  

## Overview:  
This project is a **Text Analysis Tool** designed to make working with text easier and more insightful.  
It provides features like:  
- **Text Summarization** – Generate concise summaries for long texts.  
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Identify whether text is positive, negative, or neutral.  
- **Readability Metrics** – Analyze text readability using metrics like **Flesch Reading Ease**.  
- **Tokenization & Comparison** – Compare tokenization outputs across different models (e.g., BERT, GPT).  

For detailed implementation and usage, please refer to the **[project documentation](docs/usage_examples.md)**.

## Problem It Solves:  
When dealing with large or complex texts, it's difficult to quickly understand their meaning, tone, and readability.  
This tool helps:  
- Summarize long articles or documents.  
- Understand the emotional tone of text.  
- Evaluate how easy a piece of text is to read and comprehend.

## What I Learned:  
During this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  
- **API usage** (handling API calls safely).  
- **Transformers & Tokenizers** for modern NLP.  
- **Python libraries for text analytics**.  
- Designing modular and reusable code.  
- How to integrate backend with frontend.

## Future Enhancements  
There’s a lot of potential to make this project more powerful:  
- Adding **multi-language support**.  
- Improving the summarizer with **context-aware models**.  
- Building an **interactive UI** for real-time text analysis.  
- Developing it into a complete **intelligent text processing system** with more NLP features (e.g., topic modeling, entity extraction).
