# Logic Zero-Shot Output:
*Answer:* Yes.
If all Bloops are Razzies, and all Razzies are Lazzies, then every Bloop is a Razzie and every Razzie is a Lazzie — so every Bloop is a Lazzie (transitive subset relationship).

# Logic Few-Shot Output:
*Answer:* Yes.

### Reasoning:
"All Bloops are Razzies" means every Bloop belongs to the set of Razzies (Bloops ⊆ Razzies).
"All Razzies are Lazzies" means every Razzie belongs to the set of Lazzies (Razzies ⊆ Lazzies).
By transitivity of subset relations, Bloops ⊆ Lazzies, so every Bloop is a Lazzie.

# Logic COT Output:
*Concise reasoning:* If every Bloop is a Razzie, then every Bloop belongs to the set of Razzies. If every Razzie is a Lazzie, then every Razzie belongs to the set of Lazzies. Therefore, every Bloop belongs to the set of Lazzies (transitivity of the subset relation).

*Final answer:* Yes.
