# Reasoning Few-Shot Output:
*Answer:* The sun provides energy to plants, starting the food chain.

# Reasoning COT Output:
*Step 1:* Plants use sunlight to perform photosynthesis and produce chemical energy (food).
*Step 2:* Animals eat plants to obtain that stored energy.
*Step 3:* Because plants convert sunlight into the energy that supports consumers, the sun provides the initial energy input that drives the whole food chain.

*Final answer:* The sun is the primary source of energy for the food chain, powering photosynthesis in plants which supports all other organisms.
